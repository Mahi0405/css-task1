           <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text â€” one of the most common things you'll do with CSS.
             Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features.
              We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.
              At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside.
             Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and to each other.
              We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.
